# Problem Statement 3:

##  Step #1:
Create a GoLang Program which reflects the current date & time and host it on GitHub  
Push that code to DockerHub  
In other words: Use docker to create a web application with date & time as the only content  

## Step #2:
Using the declarative approach to deploy the container with 2 replicas to k8s

#   Introduction

## Brief overview of the project:

This project demonstrates how to create a simple web application in GoLang that displays the current date and time, containerize it using Docker, and deploy it to Kubernetes with high availability (2 replicas). The application is also exposed to the internet using Kubernetes services.

## Technologies Used:

| Technology   | Purpose                    |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| GoLang       | Backend web application     |
| Docker       | Containerization            |
| DockerHub    | Container image registry    |
| GKE Cluster  | Container orchestration     |
| YAML         | Declarative configuration   |
